# Introduction
The Guide to annotate toxin genes in genomes is part of [**ToxCodAn-Genome**](https://github.com/pedronachtigall/ToxCodAn-Genome) and designed to walk you through our toxin annotation pipeline.

Before start and walking through the guide, it will be good to have some basic knowledge about bioinformatics.

If you don't have much experience in **unix**, [**python**](https://www.python.org/), [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) [**(Studio)**](https://rstudio.com/), or bioinformatics in general, then you can follow the ["Basic Bioinformatics"](https://github.com/pedronachtigall/ToxCodAn/tree/master/Guide#basic-bioinformatics) section in the ToxCodAn's guide to venom gland transcriptoms. This section has some general resources and information that may help you to better understand bioinformatics and the rest of this Guide. The Guide is not designed to teach you *everything*, so we highly recommend working through the training resources first!
