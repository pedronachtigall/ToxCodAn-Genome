## Toxin Databases

This folder contains the toxin databases designed for venomous lineages. These toxin databases are a set of curated toxin CDSs from several species within each lineage and are used in ToxCodAn-Genome's annotation process.

| Lineage_db | # of species | # of toxin CDS | Last update |
| :--------- | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Viperidae_db | XXX | YYY | dec-2022 |
| Elapidae_db | XXX | YYY | dec-2022 |

We are working to keep these toxin databases up-to-date and expand the set to other venomous lineages.

 - ***Tip:*** If you are working with some venomous lineage that is still not on the list, you can design a custom toxin database following our [guide](https://github.com/pedronachtigall/ToxCodAn-Genome/tree/main/Guide#custom-toxin-database).
    - If you believe that your custom toxin database is working well and wants to share it with the scientific community, just contact us to add it here.
